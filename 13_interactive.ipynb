      "which supports Emacs-style and vi-style editing. This library has its\n",
      "own documentation which I won't duplicate here; however, the basics are\n",
      "easily explained. The interactive editing and history described here are\n",

      "prints a primary or secondary prompt. The current line can be edited\n",
      "using the conventional Emacs control characters. The most important of\n",
      "these are: C-A (Control-A) moves the cursor to the beginning of the\n",
      "line, C-E to the end, C-B moves it one position to the left, C-F to the\n",
      "right. Backspace erases the character to the left of the cursor, C-D the\n",
      "character to its right. C-K kills (erases) the rest of the line to the\n",
      "right of the cursor, C-Y yanks back the last killed string. C-underscore\n",
      "undoes the last change you made; it can be repeated for cumulative\n",
      "effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "History Substitution\n",
      "====================\n",
      "\n",
      "History substitution works as follows. All non-empty input lines issued\n",
      "are saved in a history buffer, and when a new prompt is given you are\n",
      "positioned on a new line at the bottom of this buffer. C-P moves one\n",
      "line up (back) in the history buffer, C-N moves one down. Any line in\n",
      "the history buffer can be edited; an asterisk appears in front of the\n",
      "prompt to mark a line as modified. Pressing the Return key passes the\n",
      "current line to the interpreter. C-R starts an incremental reverse\n",
      "search; C-S starts a forward search.\n",
