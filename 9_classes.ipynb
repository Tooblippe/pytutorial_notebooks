      "Objects have individuality, and multiple names (in multiple scopes) can\n",
      "be bound to the same object. This is known as aliasing in other\n",
      "languages. This is usually not appreciated on a first glance at Python,\n",
      "and can be safely ignored when dealing with immutable basic types\n",
      "(numbers, strings, tuples). However, aliasing has a possibly surprising\n",
      "effect on the semantics of Python code involving mutable objects such as\n",
      "lists, dictionaries, and most other types. This is usually used to the\n",
      "benefit of the program, since aliases behave like pointers in some\n",
      "respects. For example, passing an object is cheap since only a pointer\n",
      "is passed by the implementation; and if a function modifies an object\n",
      "passed as an argument, the caller will see the change --- this\n",
      "eliminates the need for two different argument passing mechanisms as in\n",
      "Pascal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Python Scopes and Namespaces\n",
      "============================\n",
      "\n",
      "Before introducing classes, I first have to tell you something about\n",
      "Python's scope rules. Class definitions play some neat tricks with\n",
      "namespaces, and you need to know how scopes and namespaces work to fully\n",
      "understand what's going on. Incidentally, knowledge about this subject\n",
      "is useful for any advanced Python programmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's begin with some definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A *namespace* is a mapping from names to objects. Most namespaces are\n",
      "currently implemented as Python dictionaries, but that's normally not\n",
      "noticeable in any way (except for performance), and it may change in the\n",
      "future. Examples of namespaces are: the set of built-in names\n",
      "(containing functions such as abs, and built-in exception names); the\n",
      "global names in a module; and the local names in a function invocation.\n",
      "In a sense the set of attributes of an object also form a namespace. The\n",
      "important thing to know about namespaces is that there is absolutely no\n",
      "relation between names in different namespaces; for instance, two\n",
      "different modules may both define a function `maximize` without\n",
      "confusion ---users of the modules must prefix it with the module name.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the way, I use the word *attribute* for any name following a dot ---\n",
      "for example, in the expression `z.real`, `real` is an attribute of the\n",
      "object `z`. Strictly speaking, references to names in modules are\n",
      "attribute references: in the expression `modname.funcname`, `modname` is\n",
      "a module object and `funcname` is an attribute of it. In this case there\n",
      "happens to be a straightforward mapping between the module's attributes\n",
      "and the global names defined in the module: they share the same\n",
      "namespace! [^1]\n",
      "\n",
      "Attributes may be read-only or writable. In the latter case, assignment\n",
      "to attributes is possible. Module attributes are writable: you can write\n",
      "`modname.the_answer = 42`. Writable attributes may also be deleted with\n",
      "the del statement. For example, `del modname.the_answer` will remove the\n",
      "attribute the\\_answer from the object named by `modname`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Namespaces are created at different moments and have different\n",
      "lifetimes. The namespace containing the built-in names is created when\n",
      "the Python interpreter starts up, and is never deleted. The global\n",
      "namespace for a module is created when the module definition is read in;\n",
      "normally, module namespaces also last until the interpreter quits. The\n",
      "statements executed by the top-level invocation of the interpreter,\n",
      "either read from a script file or interactively, are considered part of\n",
      "a module called \\_\\_main\\_\\_, so they have their own global namespace.\n",
      "(The built-in names actually also live in a module; this is called\n",
      "\\_\\_builtin\\_\\_.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The local namespace for a function is created when the function is\n",
      "called, and deleted when the function returns or raises an exception\n",
      "that is not handled within the function. (Actually, forgetting would be\n",
      "a better way to describe what actually happens.) Of course, recursive\n",
      "invocations each have their own local namespace.\n",
